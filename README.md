# Sentiment-Analysis-of-Amazon-Fine-Food-Reviews

This project explores sentiment analysis of the Fine Food Reviews dataset from Amazon. 

We compare two distinct approaches: 
  1. The traditional Bag-of-Words method using VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner)
  2. A state-of-the-art deep learning method using the RoBERTa model from Hugging Face.

The goal is to analyze the sentiment expressed in the reviews and evaluate the performance and insights provided by each approach.
